        <p id="Head">How to Break a Bad Habit and Replace It With a Good One</p>
        <br><img src="/static/blogs/gen-blog/drew-beamer-uejtDqpJ7ig-unsplash.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
        <p class="desc">Bad habits interrupt your life and prevent you from accomplishing your goals. They jeopardize your health — both mentally and physically. And they waste your time and energy.  So why do we still do them? And most importantly, is there anything you can do about it?
        </p>
        <p class="Essay" id="Ess1"><br>
            Most of your bad habits are caused by two things…Stress and boredom. Most of the time, bad habits are simply a way of dealing with stress and boredom. Everything from biting your nails to overspending on a shopping spree to drinking every weekend to wasting time on the internet can be a simple response to stress and boredom. <br><br>
            But it doesn’t have to be that way. You can teach yourself new and healthy ways to deal with stress and boredom, which you can then substitute in place of your bad habits. Of course, sometimes the stress or boredom that is on the surface is actually caused by deeper issues. These issues can be tough to think about, but if you’re serious about making changes then you have to be honest with yourself. <br><br>            
            Are there certain beliefs or reasons that are behind the bad habit? Is there something deeper — a fear, an event, or a limiting belief — that is causing you to hold on to something that is bad for you? Recognizing the causes of your bad habits is crucial to overcoming them. <br><br>
            All of the habits that you have right now — good or bad — are in your life for a reason. In some way, these behaviors provide a benefit to you, even if they are bad for you in other ways. <br><br>
            Sometimes the benefit is biological like it is with smoking or drugs. Sometimes it’s emotional like it is when you stay in a relationship that is bad for you. And in many cases, your bad habit is a simple way to cope with stress. For example, biting your nails, pulling your hair, tapping your foot, or clenching your jaw. <br><br>            
            These “benefits” or reasons extend to smaller bad habits as well. <br><br>            
            For example, opening your email inbox as soon as you turn on your computer might make you feel connected. At the same time looking at all of those emails destroys your productivity, divides your attention, and overwhelms you with stress. But, it prevents you from feeling like you’re “missing out” … and so you do it again. Because bad habits provide some type of benefit in your life, it’s very difficult to simply eliminate them. (This is why simplistic advice like “just stop doing it” rarely works.) <br><br>            
            Instead, you need to replace a bad habit with a new habit that provides a similar benefit. For example, if you smoke when you get stressed, then it’s a bad plan to “just stop smoking” when that happens. Instead, you should come up with a different way to deal with stress and insert that new behavior instead of having a cigarette. <br><br>            
            In other words, bad habits address certain needs in your life. And for that reason, it’s better to replace your bad habits with a healthier behavior that addresses that same need. If you expect yourself to simply cut out bad habits without replacing them, then you’ll have certain needs that will be unmet and it’s going to be hard to stick to a routine of “just don’t do it” for very long. <br><br>

        <br><br> <p id="Head">How to Stay Motivated Despite Obstacles</p>
        <br><img src="/static/blogs/gen-blog/mika-baumeister-Y_LgXwQEx2c-unsplash.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
        <p class="desc">No man has ever achieved success without failure. Obstacles and challenges are part of what makes life interesting. They play a vital role in the journey of life. Challenges and obstacles bring out your true potential, talents and the best in you. But the important part is not the number of failures or obstacles but how you tried and tried to achieve your success. This is what makes many great personalities in today’s world unique; their passion to keep striving towards their goal.
        </p>
        <p class="Essay" id="Ess2"><br>
        <span style="color: green; font-size: 1.8rem;">7 tips on how to stick to your goals</span> <br>
        <span style="color: green;">1. Make a plan and write it down.</span> <br>
        The first thing you want to determine is what your plan is going to be. A well-thought-out plan will give you direction and structure. Write down what you want to achieve and the time frame in which you want to achieve it. The physical act of writing down a goal makes it real and tangible. <br><br>
        <span style="color: green;">2. Ensure your plan is specific.</span> <br>
        Make your goals specific. Vague goals are difficult to stick with and will set you up for failure. Goals must be clear and well defined. This means they’re specific, measurable, attainable and include a timeline. <br><br>
        Example of a specific plan: You want to run a 5K race, and you want to complete it in 25 minutes in the May 2021 competition run. You should create a training plan to help you work up to achieving the 25-minute mark – this includes tracking your progress along the way and setting weekly and monthly goals to hit. <br><br>        
        By giving yourself the appropriate amount of time to prepare and tracking your progress and training, you are setting yourself up to achieve your goal. <br><br>
        <span style="color: green;">3. Make your goals feel easier to achieve.</span> <br>
        Break your goals into smaller portions that are easier to achieve and that will ultimately bring you closer to sticking to and achieving them. Ambitious goals are inspiring, but they can also be intimidating and without an attainable action plan, you are setting yourself up for failure. <br><br>
        To achieve your goal, define it, and with the end in mind, work backwards and focus on the sub-goals or tasks that will get you there. <br><br>        
        Example of making your goal feel easier to achieve: You want to run a marathon. Start by having a smaller goal of running two miles a day and work your way up to five miles a day, then ten and so on. You can easily make daily improvements that will build your confidence to take on the next step. <br><br>        
        You’ll ultimately reach your goal of running and completing that marathon. <br><br>
        <span style="color: green;">4. Hold yourself accountable.</span> <br>
        Another idea of how to stick to your goals is to create accountability for yourself. One way of doing this is to share your goals and progress with someone who is directly involved in the goal. Tell a friend or a co-worker about your goal, or you could even join a group where you have the ability to share your progress. <br><br>
        <span style="color: green;">5. Stay motivated.</span> <br>
        Being motivated is also a huge part of sticking to your goals. One of the most significant things scientists have found is that staying motivated throughout the journey is a matter of working on tasks that are just on the edge of our current abilities – tasks that are not too ambitious or difficult but not too easy either. They’re just enough to keep us invested in the challenge. <br><br>
        <span style="color: green;">6. Be consistent.</span> <br>
        Staying consistent is extremely important if you want to achieve your goals, because if you take time off, it will be tough to get back into the routine of working toward them. If you struggle with consistency and discipline, try: <br><br>

        ~ &nbsp; Writing things down. <br><br>
        ~ &nbsp; Staying consistent in your thinking and mindset. <br><br>
        ~ &nbsp; Creating a schedule for yourself. <br><br>
        ~ &nbsp; Having reminders of your goals and plan on action on your phone and calendar. <br><br>
        <span style="color: green;">7. Celebrate every win (big or small).</span> <br>
        Focus on the journey, not the destination. Celebrating each win is an important way to track your progress and achievements along the way, which helps you feel good and keeps you motivated so you eventually crush your goals! <br><br>

        <br><br> <p id="Head">Success Secrets</p>
        <br><img src="/static/blogs/gen-blog/success-hd-wallpaper-1366x768.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
        <p class="desc">Life is a stage and we are the actors. We face different situations in life. According to those situations we play different roles. But there is one common goal each one of us have. That is to be successful in life. Everyone be it from rags to riches, wants to be successful. Being successful is very subjective. Some consider them  successful if they earn more money while some may consider themselves successful if they follow their passion. However, to achieve all this we have a potion called “ Secrets of Success”.
        </p>
        <p class="Essay" id="Ess4"><br>
            Success has become a very deceptive word. Success is measured in terms of money one has. The whole world has become Ramanujacharya, Ballabhacharya and Shankaracharya did. Social work of reform may bring success to a man as it did in the case of Dr.Ambedkar. One may gain success as a singer, a dancer or as an actor. One may gain success in industry or business too. <br><br>
            In any of these cases the greatest secret- an open secret- is hard labor. Gujar mal Modi the initiator of Modi industrial empire had studied only up to 7th class. But hard work made him a multimillionaire. Ravi Shankar became a great musician by practicing hard. The example of Kapil Dev as a successful cricketer is another one. <br><br>            
            Perseverance is another secret of success. There are difficulties in the life of man. He may be discouraged even by his friend and relatives. Still he perseveres. He does not leave his efforts. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Mahatma Phule., De Valera and Joan of Arc faced problems at every step. Still they persevered – didn’t stop midway and gained success. <br><br>            
            Mental balance and sweet tongue are the virtues that bring success to man. Rafi Ahmad Kidwai never lost the balance of his mind. Tagore was so sweet tongued that people would flock around him. So were Raja Ram Mohan Roy and the Hindi poet Rahim Khankhana. All secured success in their own field. <br><br>            
            Innovation and wit are two other qualities to be successful. It was the wit of Birbal that made him the greatest courtier in the history of India. A large number of Nobel Prize winners got success through their great innovations. The most successful women IPS Kiran Bedi got Magsaysay award for her innovation in Tihar Jail at Delhi, the abode of greatest criminals of India. As Director General of Jails she introduced many social, economic and spiritual programmes in the jail. <br><br>            
            Perfect devotion or faith in a principle also leads to success. Social workers working in the tribal belt of India have achieved great success. They are silent guides of crores of tribals leading very hard life. These dedicated highly educated young men have identified themselves with the poor tribals. They have gained success in the field as the vociferous Ministers could not. Hard labor, perseverance, mental balance, sweet tongue, innovative skills and wit together with whole hearted dedication to work are the secrets of success. <br><br>

        <br><br> <p id="Head">How You’d Spend a Million Dollars in Lottery Money</p>
        <br><img src="/static/blogs/gen-blog/giorgio-trovato-BRl69uNXr7g-unsplash.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
        <p class="desc">People around the world have all sorts of ideas and dreams. However, there is always a limitation to making such dreams or ideas become a reality. Most of the time, the limitation is always financial, and whatever one thinks or dreams of, accomplishing it never comes to fruition. Therefore, I asked myself two questions. What would I do if I had a million dollars? What would it be like not to have money problems?
        </p>
        <p class="Essay" id="Ess5"><br>
            To be honest, having money is one thing but having a lot of it is a different thing. There are many things anyone could think about if he or she were given a million dollars to spend. Some will become crazy and spontaneous. Others will become extremely flashy and show off in all sorts of ways. However, a few may think of the future and invest some of the money before spending it all on material things. <br><br>
            Personally, if I had a million dollars, I would do the following. I would first buy myself a good car, which I know sounds unreasonable but I think of this as a way of showing am worth a million bucks. Becoming a millionaire is a strategic process that needs a concrete plan in terms of investments and risks that one would have to take. There is nothing as bad as having a lot of money and then having none in the future. Therefore, having that car might not be a good investment decision but the car will always be a reminder that I should work hard to maintain that status. <br><br>            
            Secondly, I would put some money to take me through college. I will ensure that I have the best resources that will make me excel in college because that is the most important step in becoming a rational thinker. In the future, I will need to make good investment decisions and a college education will help me do that. Therefore, even if I use the whole amount of study, it would be worth it. However, a million dollars are too much for college. I will have more than enough for my college education. <br><br>            
            Thirdly, I would buy a house. This will save me a lot in terms of mortgage payments in the future and therefore, I would put that money into better use. Most people wish to own a house but they cannot afford it. Therefore, having a million dollars will provide various opportunities like getting a house and fulfilling other wants. I will furnish that house with the best quality of furniture. This is important to me because my home would be the place where I would be heading to after long hours of work. <br><br>            
            After all, the major reason why people work so hard in life is so that they can own a good home, take care of their family, and live a better life. Thus, having a million dollars would enable me to get all that and the interesting thing is that I would not have worked hard for it. That is not to say that I am lazy. This is just to mean that no one would grab the opportunity if it presents itself. <br><br>            
            Lastly, I will put the rest of that money in a fixed deposit account so that I will be able to use it in the future to start a business and make more millions of dollars. The good thing is that it will earn interest and that would come in handy too. <br><br>

A place to throw concerns away or a place that may remind you of beautiful memories and you love sitting in it reminiscences those moments. Also it may be a place to change the mood.

            One of the holiest pilgrimages in north India, Kedarnath is situated in Uttarakhand. It is located at an altitude of 3,584 m above sea level, near the head of river Mandakini. A popular destination for Hindu pilgrims, Kedarnath is one of the four major sites in India’s Chota Char Dham pilgrimage that also includes Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. <br><br>
            It is the most remote of the four Char Dham sites and is flanked by breathtaking snow-clad peaks. Known for the ancient Shiva Temple, a trip to Kedarnath is an exhilarating experience. Like the other sites, Kedarnath closes on the first day of the Hindu month of Kartik (October-November) and reopens in Vaishakh (April-May) every year. <br>           
            Kedarnath, one part of the Chota Char Dham <br><br>            
            The shrine is submerged in snow for about half a year when the Lord is shifted to Ukhimath. According to a legend, the temple came into existence as a result of the Pandavas’ search for Lord Shiva to atone for their sins for killing their brethren during the Kurukshetra war. Lord Shiva avoided all attempts to meet the brothers and stopped at Kedarnath and took the form of a bull and started to force himself into the ground, leaving only his hump visible. The willpower and determination of the Pandavas impressed Lord Shiva and he forgave their sins, blessed them and allowed them to worship him at Kedarnath. It is said that the stone-like structure that is worshiped here is the hump of the bull. <br><br>

Normally, I reserve that kind of enthusiasm, almost expecting to be disappointed. The thing is, Captain America is a special kind of property. <br><br>
            It almost shouldn’t be made into a movie. It’s just too weird. Steve Rogers was dreamed up long ago, in a very different world. The idea of a red, while, blue superhero means something so different today, depending on who’s looking at it than it did in 1941 when Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created him. He’s idealistic in a way that our common ironic worldview should have a hard time accepting. In fact, a character made into a movie by a huge media conglomerate, who’s face is all over products, but who is also supposed to represent the best of us, just doesn’t seem to make much sense. But then, it kind of does. <br><br>            
            I think I should just say that Captain America is my favorite superhero. In my incredibly jaded life, he’s one fictional element I just have to respect and like. I love that he shouldn’t work, but everyone who writes him seems to do so with a reverence, which keeps him pure, and for that reason, it’s very hard to find a bad portrayal of Captain America. No one ever took Cap to a dark place and turned him into a broken and grim character. He’s the best thing about Superman, but without having godlike powers at his disposal. Sure, he’s very skilled, but he’s just a man at the end of the day. Portrayed correctly, Steve Rogers is a hero because he’s Steve Rogers, and it has nothing to do with a super soldier serum. <br><br>            
            The same can be said of Peter Parker, but I relate to Peter Parker much more than I look up to him. And yes, I can say that I look up to Captain America, even if he is a fictional figure. He’s representative of what we can be if we stick to our principles and be the person we know we should. You do that, and people will look up to you. They’ll follow you. <br><br>            
            Who doesn’t want to be that? <br><br>            
            I love the shield flinging and I love the mail costume in all the silly colors. I love that he exists both in the past and the present. There is something about the way World War II veterans looked at their role in that conflict that is so incredibly admirable, and a cartoon though he may be, Steve Rogers captures that and brings it to these stories today. That was was about doing the right thing, and doing your job and making sure your buddies got through it too. No one doubted it, and it may have been awful, but it had to be done. Someone had to lead you over that hill, and he was the best guy you could know. That guy was Steve Rogers. <br><br>            
            I’m sure it’s not the same if you’re not American, but at the same time, there’s still something there. Being patriotic is not the same as jingoism. Being proud if who you are and where you’re from isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Aspiring to do and be better is something great, and if it takes a fictional character to do that, so be it. <br><br>            
            It’s not as if I think Captain America is real, and if he was it would be a political mess, but because he’s not, he works as a great symbol. This is how I look at him. I know he’s used to sell comic books, and now donuts, and Chris Evans’ abs, but he is what you make of him, and to me, that is a totem of a good guy, and a better person, and if the Cap Mighty Mugg on my shelf puts me just a little closer to that, then I’ve come out ahead. <br><br>            
            Even with all this said, I was surprised that when I saw (fake) footage of (fictional) Captain America fighting (simulated) Nazis, I got some chills, and I found myself feeling something real in the face of what is basically a commercial for a movie. But it was a real feeling, and I’ll take it, and for once, mercifully, put my sarcasm and ironic detachment on a shelf, and just root for the good guys, since, in this instance, I can clearly define who the hell the good guys are. That tiny catharsis keeps me going just a little better than I would have been without it. <br><br>            
            And that’s why I love Captain America. <br><br>
