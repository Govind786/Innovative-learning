        <p class="desc">Although first founded as an academic discipline in the 1950s, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is really starting to gain momentum. If you fancy yourself helping shape the future of all humans, AI is where you can make an impact. And according to <span style="color: blue;">Indeed</span>, the demand for talent and the cash to pay for it is certainly there. <br><br>
        One approach to AI, called <span style="color: blue;">Machine Learning</span>, specializes in helping computers learn from data,identify patterns, and make decisions without the need for constant programming. It’s beingapplied to everything from self-driving cars and content recommendations, to healthcare and theenvironment. 
        </p>
        <p class="Essay" id="Ess1"><br>
            When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.  <br><br>
            Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent that these can be concretely defined. Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason out any subject. But others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgments that are subject to human experience.   <br><br>           
            As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optical character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.  <br><br>            
            AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based on mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and more.  <br><br>
            The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room. <br><br>
            Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision. <br><br>            
            Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate. <br><br>
            Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong. Weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you. <br><br>
            Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms. <br><br>

        <br><br> <p id="Head">Deep Learning</p>
        <br><img src="/static/blogs/tech-blog/kevin-ku-w7ZyuGYNpRQ-unsplash.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
        <p class="desc">Deep Learning is a technique that uses things like neural networks, self-organizing maps, and stacked autoencoders to implement Machine Learning. With hardware speeds reaching new heights and more data being collected than ever, deep learning technologies are a top priority of tech giants like Google and Facebook, but also anyone who wants to take advantage of data.
        </p>
        <p class="Essay" id="Ess2"><br>
            Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence – a machine learning technique that teaches computers and devices logical functioning. Deep learning gets its name from the fact that it involves going deep into several layers of network, which also includes a hidden layer. The deeper you dive, you more complex information you extract.
            Deep learning methods rely on various complex programs to imitate human intelligence. This particular method teaches machines to recognise motifs so that they can be classified into distinct categories. Pattern recognition is an essential part of deep learning and thanks to machine learning, computers do not even need to depend on extensive programming. Through deep learning, machines can use images, text or audio files to identify and perform any task in a human-like manner. <br><br>
            All the self-driving cars you see, personalised recommendations you come across, and voice assistants you use are all examples of how deep learning is affecting our lives daily. If appropriately trained computers can successfully imitate human performance and at times, deliver accurate results – the key here is exposure to data. Deep learning focuses on iterative learning methods that expose machines to huge data sets. By doing so, it helps computers pick up identifying traits and adapt to change. Repeated exposure to data sets help machines understand differences, logics and reach a reliable data conclusion. Deep learning has evolved in recent times to become more reliable with complex functions. It’s no wonder that this particular domain is garnering a lot of attention and attracting young professionals. <br><br>
            To say Deep Learning is important is, to say nothing about its growing popularity. It contributes heavily towards making our daily lives more convenient, and this trend will grow in the future. Whether it is parking assistance through technology or face recognition at the airport, deep learning is fuelling a lot of automation in today’s world.  <br><br>
            However, deep learning’s relevance can be linked most to the fact that our world is generating exponential amounts of data today, which needs structuring on a large scale. Deep learning uses the growing volume and availability of data has been most aptly. All the information collected from these data is used to achieve accurate results through iterative learning models. <br><br>
            How do Neurons work?  <br><br>
            When the input nodes are provided with information, each node is assigned a value (in numerical form). Nodes with higher numbers have more activation value, and based on the transfer function and connection strength, nodes transfer the activation value. <br><br>
            Once the nodes receive the activation value it calculates the entire amount and modifies it according to the transfer function. The next step in the process is applying the activation function which helps the neuron to decide if a signal needs to be passed. After the activation process, weights are assigned to the synapses, to design the artificial neural network. Weights are crucial for teaching an ANN how to function. Weights can also be adjusted to decide the extent to which signals can be passed. <br><br>
            Activation weights are frequently altered while training an Artificial Neural Network. Following the activation process, the network reaches the output nodes. This is the step which acts as an interface between the user and the system. The output node interprets the information for the user to understand. Cost functions compare the expected and real output to evaluate the model performance. Depending on your requirement, you can choose from a range of cost functions in order to reduce loss function. A lower loss function will result in a more accurate output. <br><br>

        <p class="Essay" id="Ess3"><br>
            Amazon Alexa, also known simply as Alexa, is a virtual assistant AI technology developed by Amazon, first used in the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Echo Dot, Echo Studio and Amazon Tap speakers developed by Amazon Lab126. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news. Alexa can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation system. Users are able to extend the Alexa capabilities by installing "skills" (additional functionality developed by third-party vendors, in other settings more commonly called apps) such as weather programs and audio features.It uses NLU (natural language understanding), speech recognition and other weak AI to perform these tasks. <br><br>
            Alexa can perform a number of preset functions out-of-the-box such as set timers, share the current weather, create lists, access Wikipedia articles, and many more things. Users say a designated "wake word" (the default is simply "Alexa") to alert an Alexa-enabled device of an ensuing function command. Alexa listens for the command and performs the appropriate function, or skill, to answer a question or command. When questions are asked, Alexa converts sound waves into text which allows it to gather information from various sources. Behind the scenes, the data gathered is then sometimes passed to a variety of sources including WolframAlpha, iMDB, AccuWeather, Yelp, Wikipedia, and others to generate suitable and accurate answers. Alexa-supported devices can stream music from the owner's Amazon Music accounts and have built-in support for Pandora and Spotify accounts. Alexa can play music from streaming services such as Apple Music and Google Play Music from a phone or tablet. <br><br>
            In the home automation space, Alexa can interact with devices from several manufacturers including SNAS, Fibaro, Belkin, ecobee, Geeni, IFTTT, Insteon, LIFX, LightwaveRF, Nest, Philips Hue, SmartThings, Wink, and Yonomi. The Home Automation feature was launched on April 8, 2015. Developers are able to create their own smart home skills using the Alexa Skills Kit. <br><br>
            There are a number of ways messages can be sent from Alexa's application. Alexa can deliver messages to a recipient's Alexa application, as well as to all supported Echo devices associated with their Amazon account. Alexa can send typed messages only from Alexa's app. If one sends a message from an associated Echo device, it transmits as a voice message. Alexa cannot send attachments such as videos and photos. <br><br>
            Alexa for Business is a paid subscription service allowing companies to use Alexa to join conference calls, schedule meeting rooms, and custom skills designed by 3rd-party vendors. At launch, notable skills are available from SAP, Microsoft, and Salesforce. <br><br>

        <br><img src="/static/blogs/tech-blog/Robots.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
        <p class="desc">While you can probably visualize robots working their magic in manufacturing, today’s newest robots have a wide range of applications including medical and surgical uses, personal assistants, security, warehousing, logistics, and space or ocean exploration. Go on, make Jacques Cousteau jealous.
        </p>
        <p class="Essay" id="Ess4"><br>
            Even with primitive intelligence, robots have demonstrated ability to generate good gains in factory productivity, efficiency and quality. Beyond that, some of the "smartest" robots are not in manufacturing; they are used as space explorers, remotely operated surgeons and even pets – like Sony's AIBO mechanical dog. In some ways, some of these other applications show what might be possible on production floors if manufacturers realize that industrial robots don't have to be bolted to the floor, or constrained by the limitations of yesterday's machinery concepts. <br><br> 
            With the rapidly increasing power of the microprocessor and artificial intelligence techniques, robots have dramatically increased their potential as flexible automation tools. The new surge of robotics is in applications demanding advanced intelligence. Robotic technology is converging with a wide variety of complementary technologies – machine vision, force sensing (touch), speech recognition and advanced mechanics. This results in exciting new levels of functionality for jobs that were never before considered practical for robots. <br><br>             
            The introduction of robots with integrated vision and touch dramatically changes the speed and efficiency of new production and delivery systems. Robots have become so accurate that they can be applied where manual operations are no longer a viable option. Semiconductor manufacturing is one example, where a consistent high level of throughput and quality cannot be achieved with humans and simple mechanization. In addition, significant gains are achieved through enabling rapid product changeover and evolution that can't be matched with conventional hard tooling. <br><br>
            A key robotics growth arena is Intelligent Assist Devices (IAD) – operators manipulate a robot as though it were a bionic extension of their own limbs with increased reach and strength. This is robotics technology – not replacements for humans or robots, but rather a new class of ergonomic assist products that helps human partners in a wide variety of ways, including power assist, motion guidance, line tracking and process automation. <br><br> 
            IAD’s use robotics technology to help production people to handle parts and payloads – more, heavier, better, faster, with less strain. Using a human-machine interface, the operator and IAD work in tandem to optimize lifting, guiding and positioning movements. Sensors, computer power and control algorithms translate the operator's hand movements into super human lifting power. <br><br>

        <p class="desc">They get a lot of attention in the press for their volatility, but cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin can be a super skill to learn that bridges economics and technology.

            Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual "tokens," which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. <br><br>
            The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch. <br><br>
            Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto". As of March 2021, there were over 18.6 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $927 billion. <br><br>         
            Some of the competing cryptocurrencies spawned by Bitcoin’s success, known as "altcoins," include Litecoin, Peercoin, and Namecoin, as well as Ethereum, Cardano, and EOS. Today, the aggregate value of all the cryptocurrencies in existence is around $1.5 trillion—Bitcoin currently represents more than 60% of the total value. <br><br>
            Since market prices for cryptocurrencies are based on supply and demand, the rate at which a cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another currency can fluctuate widely, since the design of many cryptocurrencies ensures a high degree of scarcity. <br><br>
            Bitcoin has experienced some rapid surges and collapses in value, climbing as high as $19,000 per Bitcoin in Dec. of 2017 before dropping to around $7,000 in the following months.Cryptocurrencies are thus considered by some economists to be a short-lived fad or speculative bubble. <br><br>            
            There is concern that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not rooted in any material goods. Some research, however, has identified that the cost of producing a Bitcoin, which requires an increasingly large amount of energy, is directly related to its market price. <br><br>            
            Cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, but other aspects of a cryptocurrency ecosystem, including exchanges and wallets, are not immune to the threat of hacking. In Bitcoin's 10-year history, several online exchanges have been the subject of hacking and theft, sometimes with millions of dollars worth of "coins" stolen. <br><br>            
            Nonetheless, many observers see potential advantages in cryptocurrencies, like the possibility of preserving value against inflation and facilitating exchange while being easier to transport and divide than precious metals and existing outside the influence of central banks and governments. <br><br>

        <p class="desc">Like everyone else out there, you probably spend a good chunk of your day on your mobile device and that’s not changing anytime soon. But instead of just consuming, you could be the creating, whether it’s for iOS or Android. Getting started doesn’t require any experience.
        </p>
        <p class="Essay" id="Ess6"><br>
            Mobile application development is the process to making software for smartphones and digital assistants, most commonly for Android and iOS. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web browser. The programming and markup languages used for this kind of software development include Java, Swift, C# and HTML5. <br><br>
            Mobile app development is rapidly growing. From retail, telecommunications and e-commerce to insurance, healthcare and government, organizations across industries must meet user expectations for real-time, convenient ways to conduct transactions and access information. Today, mobile devices—and the mobile applications that unlock their value—are the most popular way for people and businesses to connect to the internet. To stay relevant, responsive and successful, organizations need to develop the mobile applications that their customers, partners and employees demand. <br><br>            
            Yet mobile application development might seem daunting. Once you’ve selected the OS platform or platforms, you need to overcome the limitations of mobile devices and usher your app all the way past the potential hurdles of distribution. Fortunately, by following a few basic guidelines and best practices, you can streamline your application development journey. <br><br>
            You could develop two native applications. Taking advantage of native APIs and OS-specific programming languages can help you build a powerful app. Most enterprise apps, especially ones that require substantial API traffic, benefit from native development. <br><br>
            If you decide to develop native applications one at a time, you’ll likely want to begin with Android—for some of the same reasons that independent app developers often focus on Android. You’ll probably have better luck developing the full application as an MVP on Android and then converting and optimizing it to iOS after release. <br><br>            
            You will still need to debug and rewrite the code for the native language and redesign the front-end user interface, because the two operating systems function very differently, making cross-platform operation impossible. <br><br>            
            So why not start completely from scratch? While you can’t simply translate the code into a new programming language, much of the back end can be replicated cross-platform. Frameworks, libraries and third-party extensions often function identically in both environments, allowing you to avoid costly reworking. You can also use a prebuilt mobile cloud service, such as IBM Mobile Foundation, to manage the web back end. <br><br>            
            Another option is to go hybrid, taking a write-once-run-anywhere approach. Hybrid apps use a single codebase that can function on either platform. They’re typically coded in a programming language that’s universally recognized, such as Java, JavaScript, HTML or CSS. Because you’re denied access to the operating system’s native APIs, hybrid mobile application development works best for simple web applications—three- or four-page mobile applications with limited functionality. <br><br>

            Augmented Reality (AR) is the technology that superimposes an image onto a user’s view of the real world and enhances it with sound, touch, and even smell. It is a combination of the real scene viewed by the user and a virtual scene generated by the computer. AR is a technology that is going to blur the lines of reality.  <br><br>
            Augmented Reality has moved beyond headsets and gaming and permeated into numerous industries. In general terms, Augmented Reality is increasingly being adopted for a variety of uses like assembly, maintenance, repair, education, training, retail showcasing, and diagnostics.  <br><br>            
            AR makes workers more efficient by providing them with an additional layer of knowledge and insights. The workforce is already being enhanced in industries such as Pharmaceuticals, Oil and Gas, military, aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing. Augmented Reality remote assistance can improve training in situations where new hires need assistance. This tech enables real-time collaboration between field personnel and remote experts.  <br><br>
            <span style="color: green;">Defense</span>  <br>
            It helps in improving the situational awareness of the soldiers using AR technology. The tech is named as Tactical Augmented Reality (TAR). This tech has an eyepiece that assists soldiers on the battlefield to precisely locate their positions in addition to the location of others (friends and enemy soldiers).  <br><br>
            <span style="color: green;">Advertising</span>  <br>
            For example, Jaguar Land Rover put prospective car buyers in the virtual driver’s seat of its latest models without visiting the dealership. Consumers could launch the AR capability directly from a banner ad without any need to install an app. Customers can see the outside view seated at the driving seat through transparent windows.  <br><br>
            Various filters on Snapchat and Instagram are an example of Augmented Reality.  <br><br>
            Scanning your QR code using your phone’s camera provides additional information on the screen.
            Google Glass and other Head-up Displays (HUD) put Augmented Reality directly into the glasses. These glasses could be used as reminders for patients undergoing medication.  <br><br>
            Retail companies use it to help customers envisage aesthetics when new furniture is placed to redesign the interiors of their homes.  <br><br>
            Gaming – Pokemon is one of the most famous games to hit a big chord with the public.  <br><br>
            AR is used in the field of language translation  <br><br>
            Law enforcement agencies can use AR tech to recognize criminals in huge crowds.  <br><br>            
            If a car breaks down people can fix their cars using AR tech, repair and maintenance can be carried out without the help of mechanics. This tech will recognize the vehicle parts via object recognition, describe and pictures all required repair and maintenance steps in detail, and real-time, along with information about any equipment requirements.  <br><br>
